# CROWZ TOKEN

CROWZ Token is a custom ERC-20-like smart contract designed to manage a token named "CROWZ" with the abbreviation "CRW". The contract allows minting and burning of tokens, providing control over the total supply and balances of token holders.

## Description

The CROWZ Token project is implemented in Solidity and provides basic functionalities for a custom cryptocurrency token. It includes features for minting new tokens, burning existing tokens, and tracking the total supply and individual balances. This project is a simple yet effective way to understand the core mechanics of token management on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To deploy and interact with the CROWZ Token smart contract, follow these steps:

Download the project: Clone or download the repository containing the smart contract code.

Set up development environment: Ensure you have an Ethereum development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat installed.

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the CROWZ Token smart contract:

Compile the contract:

If using Remix, paste the contract code into a new Solidity file and compile it using the Solidity compiler version 0.8.18.

Deploy the contract:

If using Remix, deploy the contract directly from the Remix interface.

Interact with the contract:

Use Remix or a script to call the mint and burn functions.
